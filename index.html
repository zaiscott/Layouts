<h1>Layouts HW</h1>
    
    
    
    <p>The reading talks about 3 main points of emphasis: "Stacks", "Pies", and "Forces"</p>
    <ul>
    <li><h4>Stacks</h4> <code>d3.stack()</code> <br><br> can be used to make 2D data into stacked charts when data and element are selected.  </li>
        <li><h4>Pies</h4> <code>d3.pie()</code><br><br>  can create pie charts as it will find the starting and ending angles for each data point </li>
    <li> <h4>Forces</h4> <code>d3.force()</code><br><br>  links data to nodes by analyzing an array of data  </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Algorithim?</h3>
    
    
    <p>Each layout has its own tweaked versions of the d3 core algorrith. Pie needs all the data to have its points for the pie chart. Stacks data needs to be adjusted properly ti make data is either anchored or not. slecting a svg element and following the original d3 algortih should be suffice until the lines of code above are needed.</p>
